# Mine-Consortium-Blockchain-MCB
The simulation of consensus mechanism and implement of the MCB
Simulation: We use the VIBES, a special blockchain simulator, to provide performance evaluation for subsequent actual deployment by comparing the BAC with classical blockchain algorithms. VIBES differentiates itself from other works in its ability to simulate blockchain systems beyond bitcoin and its support for large-scale simulations with thousands of nodes. Our computations are done on a Lenovo computer with Windows Ultimate 64-bit, Intel i7-8550 CPU @ 1.80 GHz and 8.0 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3, Java JDK Version 11.0.10, Scala Version 2.13.5 and Akka Version 2.6.14. VIBES uses Unsolicited Block Push (if a node knows none of its peers has a block it can directly push it to all of them) for block broadcasting. The Master Actor (the MO in MCB) builds the core of VIBES and controls the execution of events in the blockchain network. The simulation file consists of the source code of VIBES, how to build the environment, our own log files and testing files. 
Hyperledger: We deploy the MCB platform on Hyperledger Fabric and test the performance of MCB using the Hyperledger Caliper.The MCB is implemented in a desktop running 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS with 1.6-GHz Intel Core i5 Quad-CPU and 6G RAM. Since our project is currently being implemented on a large scale, we only publish pseudocode and critical source code.
